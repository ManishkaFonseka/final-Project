In Search of Lost Time chapter 1 Swanns Way

Marcel Proust remembers his childhood in the family’s country home in Combray: the drama of bedtime when his mother failed to give him the habitual goodnight kiss, the colorful garden flowers, the water lilies on the rivulet Vivonne and the scent of the hawthorn hedges on his summer strolls. These impressions rise from his subconscious upon tasting a madeleine cake dipped in tea, filling him with a divine kind of bliss. The experience reminds him of childhood Sundays when, before High Mass, his aunt Léonie in Combray would offer him cake dipped in lime blossom tea.
